I'm Riley, a Software Developer who enjoys creating terminal applications, Minecraft mods, and the small web.

I have a personal website: https://rileys.page/

## Favourite Project
If I had to pick a favourite project I've done, right now it'd be my Box project. It's a terminal backup utility that manages rolling backups automatically. I've put a lot of work into maintaining it and getting it to where it is now. I've still got some refactoring I'd like to do for it, but it's in a pretty good place.
